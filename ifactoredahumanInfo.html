			<!-- heading for the TL;DR on human factors -->
			<h3> Human Factors - the TL;DR </h3> 
			
			<!-- explaining human factors in simple terms -->
			<p>Human factors involves making a product or system user friendly. It entails integrating humans into the design
			of a system such that the end product has a user centered design.</p>
	  
			<!-- heading for the non TL;DR on human factors -->
			<h3> Human Factors - the non TL;DR </h3>
			
			<!-- explaining human factors more in depth -->
			<p>Human factors is about applying what we know about people to the design of systems. Human factors in regards to application, the
			focus is on integrating the end user of a product into the system. When designing products it, we have to consider the demographics of the end users and how
			that impacts how the product will be used. For example, if we were designing chairs for use in college classrooms, we would not want the dimensions 
			of the chair to be that for a small child. Another thing human factors looks at is context of how the user will be using the product and 
			determining the different ways the user might utalize the product. This occurs so that the system can be designed so when the user goes to use it, 
			it works in the manner that the user expects it to work. Human factors practicioners also do this so that if the user uses the product in a way that 
			it is not supposed to be used, the system can gracefully degregate.  </p>

			<h3> Application of Human Factors </h3> 
			
			<!-- explaining what types of jobs that human factors people can do -->
			<p>People who study human factors can go into different sub-disciplines of human factors. 
			Examples of sub-disciplines are user experience and ergonomics. 
			User experience (UX) has a lot to do with evaluating the usability of a product and making sure the feedback from the end users is incorparated into 
			the design of the product. Ergonomics is making physical items that we use, such as chairs and computer mice, fit the human in a comfortable way that 
			reduces the amount of wear and tear that would take place on the body. Good ergonomic design can help prevent repetitive use injuries.

			<h3> Human Factors and Engineers: Effective Communication </h3>
			<p>Human factors practicioners what to make sure the product has a user centered design. Engineers want to make sure the functionality of the product is working. 
			Without human factors, it can be difficult to make sure a product meets all the requirements and have a product the end users can easily use. However, without 
			the engineers, we would not have a functioning product. It is important that these disciplines work together, and work well. This means that communication is 
			critical. Here are some things that I've learned are necessary in order to have human factors and engineers communicate effectively. </p>
			
			<h4>1. Understand the context of the topic of conversation. </h4>
			<p>Often, human factors will say one thing and it will mean something completely different to the engineers. Likewise, things that engineers say can have 
			a different meaning for human factors. It is important to recognize that what you are saying might not mean the same thing to somebody in a different discipline.</p>
			
			<h4>2. Think like the other discipline (sometimes) </h4>
			<p>There is a reason why different dicsiplines exist. However, with these different views come different ways of thinking (and so does miscommunication). 
			It is important to recognize, that even though you think you are talking about the same thing, sometimes that isn't the case. To help realize this, try 
			thinking about why the other discipline might be saying what they are saying. Note, this is easier said than done.</p>
			
			<h4>3. Ask for clarification questions. </h4>
			<p>It is important to recognize when you don't understand something or when you might not realize what the other person is saying. When this happens ask for 
			clarification. It never hurts to ask how something works or how something got designed. </p>
			
			<h3> Key Points for Human Factors Practicioners to Remember </h3>
			<p> Sometimes when we are busy doing our job, it is easy to forget some important things... </p>
			<h4> 1. Sometimes your design changes are unrealistic to implement </h4> 
			<p> </p>
			
			<h4> 2. That product you're evaluating is the engineer's kid </h4> 
			<p> </p>
			
			<h4> 3. Communicate to the engineers what design changes are the most important </h4> 
			<p> </p>
